			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img class="profile-photo" src="images/christopher-kelsey.jpg" alt="Chris Kelsey">
			<p>Hi, I'm Chris Kelsey. I'm a San Francisco Bay Area based Full Stack Web Developer. I moved from Phoenix Arizona to San Francisco over 11 years ago and I've refused to travel anywhere hot ever since.</p>
			<p>I've been in the technology field to some degree for over the past 8 years. I have experience with the MERN stack as well as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience with MySQL and SQL Server, Python, and Ruby as well as experience with data analysis and some Java experience. </p>
			<p>Also, I'm tall, but not so tall that I'll make you uncomfortable. In spare time I enjoy rock climbing and crossfit, but don't worry, I keep it to myself. Finally, as you can tell from my picture, I like to keep my beard on point.</p>
